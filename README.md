## Install

### Prebuilt executable

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/morngrar/timediff/releases), put it somewhere in your PATH. If you're running bash as your shell, you can also enable command tab completion by following the instruction in the [tab completion section](#tab-completion).

Every release is signed with gpg, the public key of which can be found [here](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=49564b7270e13347a20deee9327bdc9bf2b00d67&fingerprint=on&op=index).

### Bonzai style.

This command can be installed as a standalone program or composed into a
Bonzai command tree.

Standalone

```
go install github.com/morngrar/timediff/cmd/timediff@latest
```

Composed

```go
package z

import (
	Z "github.com/rwxrob/bonzai/z"
	timediff "github.com/morngrar/timediff"
)

var Cmd = &Z.Cmd{
	Name:     `z`,
	Commands: []*Z.Cmd{help.Cmd, timediff.Cmd},
}
```

## Tab Completion

To activate bash completion just use the `complete -C` option from your
`.bashrc` or command line. There is no messy sourcing required. All the
completion is done by the program itself.

```
complete -C timediff timediff
```

If you don't have bash or tab completion check use the shortcut
commands instead.

## Embedded Documentation

All documentation (like manual pages) has been embedded into the source
code of the application. See the source or run the program with help to
access it.
